Read 94677634 BAM records:
  kept 65269665 primary alignments (74.0%), of which 32331542 reverse reads
  skipped 16531615 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (18.7%)
  skipped 5489184 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (6.2%)
  skipped 962916 unmapped reads (1.1%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 9467763.4 records/sample (5137191-12923849)
    kept 61.2%-73.9% of these

Built 452390 loci comprising 32938123 forward reads and 30042311 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 215.8 (sd: 49.0).

Genotyped 452390 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=13.4x, stdev=2.3x, min=8.8x, max=16.7x
  mean number of sites per locus: 203.6
  a consistent phasing was found for 48475 of out 58014 (83.6%) diploid loci needing phasing
